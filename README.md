### System Overview

## Setup
Environment variables are required for this setup.  
If you are to run this project, you need to create a `.env` file in `Backend` and include the appropriate environment variables.  
If the file is already there in your copy of the project, just continue.  

1. `cd Backend`
2. `npm i`

The app entrypoint is in `app.ts`

## Running

1. `nodemon`
2. Access application endpoints through a program like Postman (_**the frontend is not finished or in a runnable state**_)

### Example application flow
The databases have had some base data added.

**Provided JSON login - teacher:**
```json
{
    "userID": "aoc@cphbusiness.dk",
    "password": "secret"
}
```

**Provided JSON login - student:**
```json
{
    "userID": "cs340@cphbusiness.dk",
    "password": "secret"
}
```

1. Login with your user of choice by sending a POST request to `localhost:3000/login`
2. Copy the token you receive as a response and create a new request to your endpoint of choice.
3. As an example, get all users by making a GET request to `localhost:3000/rolecall/users/all` with the header `Authorization: Bearer <Token>`.

Some routes are protected more than others, such as some being limited to teachers only.


### Endpoints

**All endpoints point to `localhost:3000`**
